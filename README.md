# Symptom_Tracker
Symptoms Tracker is an application designed to track health condition symptoms such as dizziness. When a patient suffers from a condition, it helps his or her physician to know about accompanying symptoms for more adequate treatment options. However, it is generally noticed that patients find it difficult to track the symptoms of that condition every time they go through it. It is even a bigger challenge to submit complete information to the doctor. With Symptoms Tracker, we hope to design an app which will help symptom tracking and monitoring easy. Doctors can have instant and continuous access to their patient data so as to be able to provide more adequate and timely advice to the patient for treatment options. The app is design such that minimal input is required from the user to track a symptom. Because this is storing patient health data, it also designed with security in mind. Symptoms tracker is an IOS-based app. IOS provides a sleek and simple interface and has ease of use controls to display to it. 7 out of 10 people uses Apple phones.
